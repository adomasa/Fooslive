# Fooslive
Fooslive analyses live/recorded table football game based on image recognition. It provides such data as score, ball heatmap, other ball movement data.
Currently ball recognition is only based color recognition, so in order to use app properly, the ball must stand out of its environment. Lack of light, merging colors will heavily influence the results.
